//! Tessellation features.
//!
//! # Tessellation mode
//!
//! Tessellation is geometric information. Currently, several kind of tessellation is supported:
//!
//! - *point clouds*;
//! - *lines*;
//! - *line strips*;
//! - *triangles*;
//! - *triangle fans*;
//! - *triangle strips*.
//!
//! Those kind of tessellation are designated by the `Mode` type.
//!
//! # Tessellation abstraction
//!
//! The tessellation is an abstract concept that depends on the backend. Thatâ€™s why `Tessellation`
//! is an associated type found in `HasTessellation`.
//!
//! You create a new `Tessellation` with the `new` function, and you can render it with `render`.
